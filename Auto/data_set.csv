"Extremely slow and bad customer service

","I don&apos;t like leaving bad reviews, but this situation has cost me a lot of nerves and time &amp; still didn&apos;t get solved after over a month of chaos.I&apos;ve ordered an item that cost quite a lot of money and since it arrived faulty, I returned it right away to them on 6th December. By law and their own policy, I should&apos;ve received a refund no later than in 14 days, however, we&apos;re now far away from the expected dates as you can see.Each time I&apos;ve made contact with them, would get told to wait &quot;24-48 hrs&quot; in which I&apos;ll definitely receive an answer, but of course, I&apos;d never receive an answer until I call them again. I don&apos;t talk about emailing at all, cause via email they&apos;re mostly just ignoring. I&apos;m honestly so sick of chasing them for what it seems shouldn&apos;t be my issue, but theirs and I&apos;m absolutely certain that if I wouldn&apos;t have chased them, then I&apos;d not even ever receive any answers. I&apos;d not recommend to deal with Farfetch even to an enemy, unless you don&apos;t care how much time and nerves you gonna waste over them.

"THEY ARE RACIST!

","Extremely so much slow, this is my first purchase from here and I made a purchase of exactly one thousand Euros, but none of my products have been shipped yet since morning of 31 December 7AM.They are racist to me because of I am Turkish and they do not write a reply to my e-mails. And I&apos;m so sure that&apos;s why my products were not shipped yet! Go to hell Farfetch! You stole my time and f*cked up my surprise.Farfetch is over for me before it starts, never again! But fornow please move your big ass and ship my items!

"Beware Christmas gifts!

","Beware Christmas gifts!! Very poor Xmas returns policy for a high-end retail business. I purchased an item on 13th Nov for £275 for my daughter for Christmas. After opening the gift on Christmas Day she found the item to be too large. I contacted Farfetch the week after Christmas and was advised no exchange or refund was possible! Never again!

"Horrible experience

","Horrible experience. I bought a tennis shoe from them on Nov 7, but the extended holiday season return only started a couple days later, but they did not accept my exchange the size, saying it was placed before nov 15. With the pandemic, the person gifted took longer to receive the gift than normally, but I was sure all businesses would extend the return period due to the current pandemic situation. This is absurd.And the customer service was very rude. Do not buy there if you want to exchange after.

"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH CUSTOMER SERVICER

","I had a horrible experience with Farfetch. My sister gave my daughter a shoe for Xmas that was bought in November. She bought it one month ahead because she didn&apos;t want to risk not having my daughters size available because of the supply chain issue that is going on because of covid. She bought size 8.5 thinking it was women, but it was 8.5 men. I called Farfetch to make exchange for correct size,  spoke to a very bad humored lady called Rute, and she  said they only do refund, no exchange,... but that they wouldn&apos;t be able to do it because my sister should have sent it back in less than 14 days after she bought it. This is crazy! The shoe is brand new, expensive (the size 8.5 was more than U$100 more expensive than other sizes)  and I just wanted to exchange for the correct size. Very disappointed with Farfetch. They certainly lost two  client, my sister and I, and lots of friends that also buy from them will certainly stop buying after this ...

"Faulty item. Terrible customer service

","F5YVVF bag strap broke after 2 weeks, customer service said they will look into it and ask the retailer, or I can send the item back to get repaired (2-3months wait). Waited a month for an answer from the retailer. Still nothing from them. when I asked for a refund or replacement I get told my order is out of the refund/replacement policy because more than a month passed but it was the retailer not answering fault not mine? Here I am with a new, faulty item and this is the quality customer service they offer to their customers? They told me I could take it to a repair shop myself and they could ‘maybe’ look into refunding the repair cost… Unbelievable. Never buying here again.

"Worst service EVER!

","As much as it pains me to say it, if I had to give a review between 0 and 10 I would give minus 2! I ordered from Farfetch after watching Daniel Simmons you tube channel advising how good they were and how he high recommended purchasing from them. I ordered some Y3 sneakers on the 30th of November 2021 and they still have not been dispatched from their supplier! I fully appreciate the Pandemic coupled with Christmas slows delivery of goods but it is getting onto 5 weeks now with no update on dispatch!!! I requested a refund and was told it was not possible to cancel my order even though they hadn’t been dispatched from the supplier? Farfetch then advised that they would give me an update on delivery or a refund after 2/3 business days but then changed their mind and said it was not it possible to give a refund? I have now had to contact my CC company and advise that I have been scammed and asked them to handle it on my behalf. Surely Farfetch should have a policy with their suppliers whereas if the goods can out be dispatched in a timely manner i.e. 1 week the customer should be given a refund???? I order sneakers from global suppliers and I must say that unequivocally this is the worst service I have ever received! For that reason I will not be ordering anything from Farfetch again and would not recommend to anyone else to. A very disgruntled customer!!!!!

","I recently had very bad experience with Browns fashion ( which is owned by Farfetch) and to be honest this has really deterred me from buying anything from Farfetch as well. You should really consider how your reputation get affected by company like Browns Fashion which is an absolute fraud. I ordered expensive jewelry from Browns Fashion and I got delivered an empty box with no item inside. Browns Fashion supposedly conducted internal investigation and concluded that all went well. Can you imagine this.. If you want consumers to trust Farfetch do something about this fraud company called Browns Fashion.

"Only buy if you want to loose your money

","I can give 0 stars as well. I ordered my usual size UK 10 shoe from farfetch. The site everywhere boasts of easy returns. My shoe that came was very loose. When trying to return, it shows that order is non returnable. I mean I understand for certain products to be non returnable but a 1.5 k shoe which is loose should be returned and my correct size be delivered. I have the whole packaging available. If this is somekind of a weird policy, They should specifically list non returnable in front of the products so that customers like me are not duped.

","Don’t use this company. £731 of expensive jeans arrived in envelopesNo boxes.  2 of 3 items didn’t fit. The Waybill enclosed from the boutique in Portugal had to go via Amsterdam. The Waybill enclosed from the boutique in Italy had to go to Italy. ????  This didn’t make sense to me. Phoned Customer service. “Yes” I was told “both correct”. The refund from Portugal took hours of communication but 5 weeks later I received a refund. However, Ive been informed today almost 2 months later that the jeans from Italy were never picked up.  The assumption being that I still have them. NOT CORRECT!!  My husband handed the package to the DHL driver.  MyTheresa, The OUTNET, &amp; Net-a-Porter use DHL. In 15 years I’ve never had a problem. Reading the reviews here it appears that I’m not the only one. STAY CLEAR OF this company. You may lose a lot of money like I did.

"Just awful

","Just awful. Paid 12 pounds for shipping on a pair of pricey shoes, took a week to come, ordered size 8 US. (On their website it literally says US size, no other option) As stated on website. Size 8 US - converts to Size 6 UK. So I was expecting a UK Size 6 to arrive. Instead I got a UK 8 Mens. Called customer service explaining they’ve sent the wrong shoe; and she said she doesn’t even know if I can be refunded the postage. I’m beyond annoyed, as on the box it says ‘farfetch, dispatched from Dover street market’So I googled dover street market, the supplier, they’re selling the shoes with no postage fee. So you’ve whacked on 12 pounds for no reason? Because you’re under the name farfetch? I’m just frustrated - I needed them, I can’t just buy a new pair, they were very expensive. Now I have to wait apparently 20 business days for a refund. Don’t recommend

"Pricing Issue

","I bought a jacket from Farfetch which was advertised as £471.67, reduced to £283.00 and promoted as 40% off.To my surprise, when I received the item, the original price was still on the label. This stated that the jacket was 399 Euros, around £343 at the time of purchase. At a discount of 40%, the jacket should have cost me no more than £205.80.I have notified Farfetch of this issue, however they have not offered to refund me the difference.I am very disappointed with the service and will take my custom elsewhere in the future.

Nearly a week later, still no meaningful update. They claim they are waiting on DHL and the boutique to respond to their emails. Apparently they don’t have the ability to call these companies, they can only email (despite me being able to get through to DHL by phone in 5 mins, who don’t have the package!). They seem to be unclear whether this package has been despatched or not, some customer services staff say it has, other say it hasn’t. Feel like I’m in a constant loop of inaction and incompetence

","TOTAL DISASTER IF YOU NEED TO RETURN GOODS. REBATE NON EXISTENTReturned orders are handled by nothing less than dreadful mismanagement.  I returned 2 items that arrived together The return waybills were totally different.  Package 1 returned 17/11/21 The postal waybill made out to Farfetch in Amsterdam, but not to the boutique in Italy where the jeans originated.  Package 2 returned 22/11/21 the waybill was for the boutique partner in Portugal.  I phoned FF for advice as I found it very confusing and was told that the different waybills were correct.  GUESS WHAT?  The parcel for Italy via Amsterdam is still stuck in customs in UK 6 weeks later.  Parcel 2 eventfully made it to Portugal but it took 5 weeks to arrive/rebate.  The business model for this company doesn&apos;t work for customers in UK I feel.  There are too many avenues for mistakes &amp; mismanagement.  The company advertises goods from European boutiques, but there is no consistency.  I see from the reviews that many customers are in my position i.e. no goods and/or no return of money!  Even when the package arrives at FF the company still has to post it to the boutique and hopes that the boutique will return the cost of the item.  I am still almost £300 out of pocket 4 days before Christmas when I need my money badly!  Customer Services make the right noises both on the phone and on this website.  However, FF is just the middleman I think.  It is the boutique that returns to money/or not!!  I guess FF just advertises for the boutiques  Be very cautious. Try a different European company like Net-A-Porter, The Outnet or My Theresa.  These companies package the items beautifully too! So Farfetch, what is our legal right here?

"Farfetched is a horrible company

","Farfetched is a horrible company. I have never experienced what they have put me through from any other company I have shopped with. I purchased $400 shirt from them on September 2nd because I was referred by a relative. I originally purchased 2 shirts but one was canceled due to it being sold out. My package was scheduled to be delivered on September 9th by fedex the package was supposedly delivered on September 8th. When I called farfetch and told them I hadn&apos;t received my package they claim I signed for it and I explained that there was no way I wasn&apos;t home I was in a meeting finalizing my child event. The company claimed to have opened up a investigation but closed it after a day and half. I reached out to fedex that told me they see I didn&apos;t sign for the package that the driver signed it and put left on the porch. I live in a apartment building and it clearly states this. If the packages was supposed to be signed that should indicate the package is of some value. So no one but me or member of my house should have signed.I contacted my bank that instructed me to resolve it with merchant I sent the letter that was sent to me by fedex executive department stating that driver signed and left the package and the company can file a claim. They just sent me a email after claim was reopen yesterday saying its closed with no detail. They are being completely dismissive to the fact I dont have a package and they are refusing to file claim with fedex. Im currently working with fedex executive department. This is really ridiculous. Im a first time customer and there is no customer service in the poor service they have provided. So they get to keep my money $400 and I have nothing and fedex stated several times they can file a claim. If the package was stolen thats not my fault they delivered with fedex and the driver illegally signed my name. They are now saying I filed a dispute with my bank which they told me too in order to get funds back and they claim its still on going which my bank has confused its not. My bank and fedex are both confused as why a dispute with my bank is preventing them for filing a claim with fedex.@farfetched what is the request for more information? What information your requested? I placed a order i never received I been trying and trying to get this resolved since September. I provided proof from fedex and still getting no help from yall.

I then ordered the same shoes from a different site because it seemed like the matter was closed. The next day, I get two emails from Farfetch. One said that they had found the same shoes with a different partner and they’d notify me once they were dispatched. Then, after that, an email saying my refund (for the previous cancelled order) had been processed. This leaves me confused - I’m still getting the shoes but I’m also being refunded? Obviously not, because no business gives away things like that for free. All in all, a totally confusing process. It’s not clear enough to the customer that they’re ordering through Farfetch who source the product from a third party. Better communication needed at all stages of customer journey. Will be returning shoes when they arrive and €160 out of pocket before Christmas. Customer service sub par - communication looked like canned responses. Won’t ever be ordering from Farfetch again.

The package was sealed with the original Farfetch tape. I immediately contacted Farfetch to sort things out, and while they said that they would look into things, they did nothing to help. I called and emailed them multiple times, but eventually they just said it wasn’t their fault and I should contact UPS instead. I contacted UPS multiple times but they’re not helping either.

After a discussion we decided to return, and she promptly returned the item via their courier pick up with tag, the coat and box intact. She even took a photo as an evidence before handed it over to a courier. Now after 10 days they are claiming the item was damaged and there was no tag in the box.

Immediately I called up the customer service, the guy on the other end was very nice and kind (the only good experience), he immediately created the return lable and requested for immediate return. We followed his instructions.... and then the nightmare started! For more than 3weeks there was no response and when calling the customer service they only said its in process... eventually after putting pressure they said we sent the shoes after use and that their reseller does not accept our return. They literally said they its our word against their reseller&apos;s word! But did i buy from their reseller?? or did we not follow the instructions from farfetch! After a traumatic weeks passing by (500 EURO for shoes is not less!) and putting pressure via customer service of Jimmy Choo, finally we received our money back. During COVID period, I have become a online shopping adict and never had any issues by anyone. However after this experience at Farfetch, i decided to be cautious and NEVER EVER buy from them!

"Worst ordering experience of my life, please deliver my orders.

","I ordered this bag along with another YSL bag from FARFETCH for my Mother’s birthday. Unfortunately I cannot review EITHER bag, as despite being marked as “delivered” on my FARFETCH account, I have not received either of them.Having previously had wonderful experiences ordering through FARFETCH, I trusted that they would deliver my goods as usual. This was NOT the case however, after taking my money &amp; approving the purchase, sending a second confirmation that the order has been processed &amp; in transit to my country (thus entering into the partner-customer contract as outlined in section 7 of the terms &amp; conditions on the FARFETCH website), both items were shipped to my address as normal, cleared customs &amp; processing all normal &amp; timely as you expect with DHL express. I received an email from FARFETCH asking me to review my order &amp; saw that my account had updated to show the order had been delivered. This was not the case, it had not even arrived in the same state. I contacted DHL to see what was going on with the tracking as it was inconsistent with what FARFETCH’s system reflected, and DHL told me that FARFETCH had requested for the items to be returned to the shipper. They saw no reasonable explanation for this as both packages cleared all customs processing &amp; advised I call FARFETCH for further assistance &amp; clarification and that DHL needed FARFETCH to contact them to allow them to continue ahead with the delivery to my address. Several days of phone calls back &amp; forth with FARFETCH &amp; DHL later, BOTH my items have been sent back to the shipper, despite being reassured by FARFETCH representatives that they would contact DHL to have it delivered to me as scheduled. (When in fact, DHL informed me that they received a second request from FARFETCH to return the items to the shipper &amp; not deliver to me).Throughout all this time I received no correspondence or explanation from FARFETCH as to why this was happening. Each time I called FARFETCH said my items would still be delivered to me this week &amp; also that a supervisor would contact me ASAP. I still have not gotten to speak with anyone in management (the Customer Service Advisors were all very polite &amp; tried their best, but it was obviously a matter that needed urgent attention from someone higher up, so they are not to blame).I am also still awaiting replies to my emails to FARFETCH Customer Service requesting an update on what is happening &amp; when I can finally expect my orders to be delivered, like I said, I have received no correspondence from FARFETCH excluding the confirmation emails of my orders, the second emails detailing my order with receipt &amp; tracking information already in transit, automated email stating my delivery would arrive today (it did not, it is currently on a plane in Singapore on it’s way to the Netherlands - the very opposite of what a FARFETCH Customer Advisor promised me yesterday during a telephone conversation). On my FARFETCH account it says that both orders have been delivered, however they never left the possession of DHL &amp; I have all of the tracking information to evidence this. I have tried to be very patient &amp; gracious as I understand it is a busy time of year, however I feel as though I cannot trust FARFETCH to deliver on their promises and I am very upset that I have no gifts to give to my Mother for her 60th birthday celebration this week. I would just like for my goods to be delivered as promised (and as the Partner Boutique is legally obligated). As I stated in the beginning, I have always had a pleasant &amp; speedy experience ordering through FARFETCH &amp; have recommended it to countless friends &amp; family members. I am very anxious &amp; hesitant to proceed with any further business through FARFETCH if this issue is not resolved satisfactorily &amp; succinctly. It is because of my previous experience that I am putting my faith in FARFETCH to do the right thing &amp; I have not spoken ill of them to anyone. Please deliver my orders to me.

Beware, they are selling very expensive things on this site but they do not own, or stand behind any of it. You are left to fend for yourself.

","My wife bought a pair of designer shoes from this joke of a company. The shoes were not right for her so she tried to return them for a refund. Three times this company has said they would send a courrier to pick up the package and yes, three times this has failed to happen. No apology, no service, and as far as I can see, no clue! I tried to intervene as my wife was getting very upset, to see what was happening, but the customer service agent, who clearly had little training in customer service, advised me that because of GDPR  she was unable to help. I pointed out, having given her all the references, order number and tracking numbers that I didn’t want any access to the account I simply wanted to know if there was going to be any delivery today, as promised. I admit I got cross on the call which I regret,  as these shoes need to be refunded within a certain time and this company doesn’t seem to care about other peoples time or money. If you are thinking of using this company, my simple advice is don’t. Appalling service.

I tried looking up the policy online but have been able to locate anything. Regardless, it would be common sense to do the adjustment as the order has not been delivered. I was on hold for 38 minutes to speak to a supervisor and was unable to be located – really, how is that possible? Today, November 9, 2021, I am still waiting for the supervisor call back and I cannot process a return and repurchase at the 22% discount because the orders are NOT fully delivered yet and now the 22% discount is no longer available. Customer service for your company is absolutely terrible especially considering how much money I have been spending here! As soon as my pending transactions are processed, I will be canceling my account and you will never see a penny from me.Update, November 9, 2021: a pair of expensive shoes from one of the orders arrived today. The soles and the letters inside the shoes of the designer name are faded. Obviously, the shoes have been worn!!! Terrible, terrible, just terrible!!!! Shop somewhere else!!!

"I’ve been shopping with Farfetch for…

","I’ve been shopping with Farfetch for many years and it’s been nice because I haven’t really had to deal with customer service. However, on my last purchase I bought a Stella McCartnwy black knit shirt that I really like, a few days after it was purchased I wore it and it was fine but on my way out the door I noticed from the mirror there’s a small hole under the armpit area, it was black so I missed it when I tried it on. Upon examining it there’s actually two other tiny holes elsewhere. I contacted Farfetch and they did looked into it with me send my them pics abs Bc the tags were cut off. I was told the return could be done so they sent be a UPS label a week later, which I had to follow up. I had to constantly follow up this return which took almost two months! All Bc of the tag being cut off. In the email and calls made by me, two of their representatives both told me that even if their boutique rejected the item due to tags not attached they would still refund me, they even emailed me a code of $30 as a courtesy, sounds great so far right? After not hearing from them after the boutique receiving the item, they emailed me saying the item cannot be refunded, against what their email and phone calls to me previously. This was a nearly $600 shirt, can you imagine? From the very beginning I asked if they shirt can be exchanged Bc I really like it, but they didn’t have it in stock. They seems to not be in the same page since I’m hearing different things. So I called again and that’s when all disappointed goes down hill, they got this guy as their rep who was basically playing games making remarks like I’m out to trick them if some sort, I asked him I wanted a replacement , he sets up all sorts of sarcastic remarks and when I asked if I can speak to a supervisor he says no, when I insisted he told me there’s no possible way of contacting a supervisor Bc the case is close. It was no longer about the return but rather about his beyond rude attitude , what kind of company has no supervisors? He was out to get me with his “word” games… for a second I forgot my point of the call Bc I was so focused on arguing with him. What kind of representatation is this? He is the front of the company, the face of it. When I told him that you guys repeats said Farfetch will refund me his email and phone sns even gave me a code as a courtesy abs he said “ yes, that is way beyond the worth of your time” I was in disbelieve, I’d Farfetch is reading this pleas for back to that call, as you said all calls are recorded. Never again Farfetch !!! If you’re a good customer , pay them and follow every policy they wrote then by all means you will live them, but IF you ever run into a special circumstance, even in the boutiques they are willing to help… don’t count on getting the exchange/ refund you deserve, $600 donated to Farfetch, I have this feeling in my stomach like I’m literally being scammed by this company.  One, their reps don’t read notes and not aware of your case, one person saying things differently than another like they don’t even know their process. Second, have you ever seen a gay person argue? That’s the rep they for helping me! He attacks the customer abs out to get you, like are you saying I’m lying? Making stuff up? It’s so unprofessional. Third, this company got no supervisor for you to talk to so incompetent gay men is all you got. I feel so sorry for all the kind and sweet representatives Bc one guy like this changes everything for them. My one advice, put your item under the microscope before cutting the tags, it’s not like the boutiques, they work differently at Farfetch. $600 for a lesson learned , a total scam , they put up their hands and basically says too bad sorry! They have their calls recorded but got no supervisors to listen… what kind of company got no supervisors for you to talk to???? Freaking scam!

","Ordered a YSL card wallet as a gift. 2 days of use and the YSL logo has completely worn off. Returned the item ( 5 days from when it was delivered) and was told that they had received other complaints about this item being faulty and to expect a full refund. Refund was issued however minus the shipping fees. I contacted customer service to ask them why I should cover the shipping fees of a faulty item. Not only did I have to go to the hassle of returning the gift but also I have to pay for it? The reply I received back was that as it had been used they had already made an exception to accept the return and therefore they cannot make another and refund the shipping. We found out the product was faulty because we had to use it and had it not been faulty we had no intention of returning it. 2 days of normal use for a designer product the label should not come off. It was returned 5 days from delivery and as stated from a customer support agent they were aware from other customers of this faulty issue. It’s unacceptable that the customer should have to cover the shipping costs for a faulty product. So now I’m left with no gift, hassle of returning the item but also have to pay the shipping costs 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼

When I checked the tracking and the picture of the parcel being delivered, I then saw a picture of the parcel being delivered to a completely different door. I live on a private road and every door on my road is brown with a classical brown brick house format. However, the picture of the delivery showed my parcel being delivered to a white house with a grey door that looks nothing like any house on my road. I phoned Farfetch and they told me it was delivered to my neighbour I explained the situation and they said they will investigate. 2 weeks pass and they tell me they can&apos;t refund me because it was delivered. What a joke that is. I phone again to explain the door situation and they ask for pictures of the doors on my road. After I sent them they agreed it was not the same door shown in this picture and that they will investigate further. Till this day (2nd November 2021) I have not received a refund or an outcome from Farfetch . This is my first and last time shopping with them.

They told me they would not provide any refund. There is absolutely no buyer protection here, no insurance on their end, nor offered to the recipient, on these expensive goods they are shipping. BEWARE, if the package is lost, you are on your own. It’s simply not worth the risk. Buy from a local retailer, from an online retailer that offers insurance or has a better policy on this, or direct from the brands. Stay away from Farfetch.

","Unbelievably bad experience, I said I wouldn’t but if my review spares at least one person from going through a similar experience then it’s worth sharing.I ordered one pair of Burberry sunglasses, and I receive a pair with a scratch on the middle of the lense. I requested for an exchange, giving the benefit of the doubt and I was told that I should place another order as farfetch does not offer exchanges. After advising the stock on their website, which wrongfully advertised that there was only one pair left, I thought I’d purchase that, and not risk losing out. Few days later, I received the item with a well scratched frame this time, which seriously makes one think if there’s a minimum of quality control on what their partners are sending out. I am 16 days in from my first order, returned both orders and have €400 pending to be returned. Customer service team is waiting to sort with their partner, as if this is my responsibility to carry, and their promise of an early refund turned out to be just a way to rid of me from their lines. Was 50 minutes on the phone on a long distance call, just to add to everything and managed to sort nothing. Really regret not purchasing from another seller, paying top dollar to receive niche brands and getting goods that would make Burberry’s hair fall off.

I contacted Farfetch and sent photos of the faulty ring. After many emails to customer service, Farfetch completely washed their hands of me. They stated that the “Partner” - I.e the retailer (who is not Farfetch apparently but a shop in Romania), insisted that this was due to wear and tear. They wouldn’t accept that a ring of that value (£300) should last far longer than 4 months and 4 wears! They have treated me absolutely appallingly - they just blame everything on the retailer yet it’s impossible to contact the retailer as the contract is with Farfetch.

At Gucci, Louis Vuitton and other designer stores if you&apos;re ever past the 14 day return period they still facilitate some kind of return or exchange since they know you paid top dollar for an item. This goes for their online orders as well. They understand that a majority of their loyal clients who shop with them consistantly do not work or live a regular 9-5  schedule with the ability to go immediately after work or on the weekend to return/exchange an item. Will definitely not shop here again after being stuck with these brand new $500 shorts that don&apos;t fit.Thank You,

I can understand the if you mistake one or the other but both is unacceptable.Then I returned the shoes but it’s been over a month and I still have yet to receive a refund from them !!!!

"Beware if you need return or exchange.

","Bought a Fendi ring for my wife’s birthday. I contacted Far Fetch to ask to exchange for a larger size. They responded saying they would not exchange. I offered to pay all shipping costs but bluntly said No. Be very cautious ordering from here. I would not use as there are many similar websites who have far better customer service and exchange policies. Very short sited service levels.

"Farfetch Disappointed Me

","I order these pants on the July 29th my delivery date was the Aug 5 (remind you I paid 45. Extra for delivery and sale taxes I believe) pants was 208. And it came up to 245.…. I was taking these pants out of town with me for an important photo shoot. I called to see what was the hold up and they where stuck in Italy customs on the 5th… (no one contact me or informed me of a delay) customer service could not help me with this delay and did not offer no suggestions or apology for this huge inconvenience.  I just got home from my trip about an hour ago and I get an email from concierge that I have a package that was delivered today. I will be returning the item, because it’s no need for them. I did not open the package to see the quality of the shorts or anything. (So I have no review on the shorts) I’m so disappointed with farfetch. This is not the first time something was stuck in customs that was order from far fetch. I never have this problem with FWRD.

"They use UPS - disaster

","Note upfront: this is really a review of UPS France, not Farfetch. But UPS does not give a toss about bad reviews. The only solution is to get businesses to stop using UPS in France.When I saw that Farfetch was going to deliver my parcel by UPS, my heart sank. I have never successfully received a parcel from UPS France on first try. Now, I live in central Paris and get deliveries successfully all the time, from all sorts of delivery companies EXCEPT UPS.UPS always says ‘I was not at home’, and tells me to pick up at a location in a different arrondissement. So it is the case this Wednesday morning. I’ve received that dreaded email.Of course I was at home. I work from home, where else would I be on Wednesday morning?In conclusion, Farfetch, do yourself and your customers a favour and switch to a different provider. Literally sticking a stamp on and putting it in the post box is better than paying overpaying UPS for their rubbish service.

"Left behind with a faulty dress and extra cost

","I bought a relatively expensive dress for around DKK 2200 from Farfetch. When I received the dress, it has a fault in one of the seam in the side. Farfetch did not wanted to cover the total tailor costs, but sent a price reduction of DKK 100. I while I had to pay DKK 300 for the repair at the tailor. Afterwards, I use the dress for a wedding party for one night. The first and only time, I used the dress the dress goes up in the seams (again) around the armpit. Therefore, I feel compelled to contact Farfetch once again. At that point I had already paid for a repair at a tailor and really don’t want any more challenges with this dress. Therefore, I’ll prefer returning the dress and receive a refund of the purchase amount.  But Farfetch does not take responsibility for this and retains my emails very late. Last time I received a message from Farfetch is about a month ago, but I have tried to contact them 3 times in the meantime, but without getting a response from them.  Now, I’m left with a defective dress that I have already spent extra resources and money to . A really bad customer experience.  I cannot recommend Farfetch to anyone.

"AVOID!!! £170 stolen from me by these crooks - shop elsewhere

","Returned a bracelet iaw Farfetch’s open box return policy (see website for details) using DHL. I followed the policy exactly, leaving the box open for the driver to verify and accept the contents. A week later I had an email saying that my parcel arrived with the contents missing, therefore I would not receive a refund. I contacted customer service stating that I had indeed returned the item, and the driver had verified its contents (iaw their policy) and accepted the parcel (if there was no bracelet, they would reject it). Farfetch should have issued my refund and reviewed their return policy, to consider whether they do a ‘closed box’ approach like most retailers. Instead I was told this was my responsibility and I would not be getting my money back. Basically, I’ve had this money stolen from me and now have to take the time to pursue the issue through trading standards. Never using Farfetch again and instead sticking with ethical businesses like End.NOTE: IF YOUR POLICY SAYS CUSTOMERS RETURN IT WITH THE BOX OPEN, THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENTS ONCE IT LEAVES THEIR CARE.

Not getting an e-mail, called again. Then I got an answer that I will need to wait 5-6 weeks, because it is custom item(which could have been told on the fist or second call, as well, or in email).

Then I complain that I never received it because they failed to put the correct address and they simply said they can’t help me nor give me a refund . I still can’t believe it.  Then they stopped answering all together. Learned my lesson to never buy designer online go in person. Not worth the aggravation.

"Buyers beware, Farfetch do not authenticate or guarantee products sent...

","Bought 2 Givenchy items from Farfetch about 3 years ago, a Black Logo Motif Printed cotton T-shirt and Black Distressed Logo Sweater, they came from 2 different boutiques in Europe, Russo Capri Italy and Greece Luisa World respectively. After the first wear of the Givenchy sweater (which was about 6 months after I purchased it because it was Summer when I purchased November in Australia) I noticed it started to fall apart, the threads holding the jumper together were disintegrating, it was 100% a fake, which made me question both items. I took the jumper into the Givenchy boutique in Westfield Centrepoint and confirmed it was a fake. So I contacted Farfetch and they gave me an automated response about items being authentic from boutiques chosen for you etc etc and that they would follow up the boutique, they never did and I never heard from them again even after chasing them up again, I pretty much gave up so they do get away with it a lot. DO NOT shop with Farfetch, it&apos;s hit a miss, Farfetch do not check or authenticate items sent and boutiques can pretty much send you what they want as long as they are on the platform, it&apos;s pretty much like Facebook Marketplace or Etsy in that sense, BUYERS BEWARE! Stick to direct from the Boutiques or authorised distributors that brands name on their website, such as Net-a-Porter, Saks or Neiman Marcus etc.

"They don&apos;t care

","Update: After two weeks Farfetch has responded to my post. But I still have not got the refund. If they fail to refund me within stated by them timeframe of 14 days, I am going to go to Small Claims Court.I have ordered a two dsquared2 items from Farfetch in May, a facemask and phone cover. They were coming from two different locations. I received first package with wrong face mask I complained to Farfetch who at first advised me to return the item for a refund (which was pretty incredible) as everyone knows those items should not be allowed to be returned. I have decided to keep the item and settled for receiving the difference in price. At that time I was told I will need to wait up to 10 days for my refund. This seem rather excessive. Trying to check status of my second package, I got in touch with DHL Express that Farfetch use. I was advised DHL could not locate it due to security breach at their Dublin depot. I was told my package was opened and contents were missing. After few days DHL informed me they definitely cannot locate the item.I contacted Farfetch immediately and was told they will investigate this with DHL and that the whole process will take up to 15 days. Please note I was able to get the confirmation myself so I passed it onto Farfetch. This did not change anything, I took Farfetch exactly 16 days to get back to me confirming something I have already told them (and provided proof of over 2 weeks ago). Now I am being told I need to wait for my refund, cause their processing time is up to 14 days. This is absolutely ridiculous. For a company that is dealing with designer goods, the approach to the customer seems to be, we don&apos;t really care.When ordering I was not expecting to have issues with both of my orders. I just wanted to get the items I paid for. Farfetch did not wait several weeks to charge my credit card. They did that immediately. But of course refunds always takes ages to complete. Additionally it was not my fault Farfetch choses to use one of the worst delivery companies out there. Still it appears I am supposed to remedy the issue by patiently waiting for them to take ages to resolve simple issue, and I am left with reordering the item, if I still want it after weeks of &quot;investigation&quot; and &quot;refund processing&quot;.Think twice about ordering through their app.

Mind you, this is like 5 minutes after I placed the order. The Farfetch site clearly states you can cancel an order, and I believe that cancelling within 5 minutes should be fine.,Farfetch would rather alienate a customer over something as simple as cancelling an order. Now I have to wait to receive the item, send it back and wait for my refund.

"Buyer Beware

","Buyer Beware, just because they have your money, doesn&apos;t mean they can guarantee your product.  I ordered a pair of shoes almost a week ago, the following day, customer service reached out to say that there was a flaw in the shoe and offered a discount to the shoe.  This went to an email address that I do not closely monitor, so I missed the communication.  Instead of following up to the initial email, I received an email stating that I was refunded and that the shoe is no longer available to send.  First, how can you send me an email to tell me the shoe is no longer available, when I purchased it over a week ago (this was verified with a correspondence email regarding the shoe). Second, even if I didn&apos;t respond in my opinion the best practice would have been to send the shoe with a note of a 15% discount to be processed should I have elected to keep the shoe.  Literally the worst case scenario is I would have sent the shoe back which is an option for the purchase anyhow.  I had my reservations about purchasing a shoe that had an origin of VITAK warehouse in Poland, so clearly I&apos;m disappointed but not surprised.  Customer service was ineffective because they were unable to determine what actually happened to the shoe.  This isn&apos;t about the money, I know I&apos;ll get it back.  It&apos;s the fact that I spent hours to find a shoe that I was really excited about.  I don&apos;t know Farfetch, with this impression as a first time customer you may have persuaded me to never shop with you again.

They didn’t know if it was a merchant error or an issue with delivery. They also told me that they were going to reach out to the merchant and should be hearing back in about 1-2 business days. 5 days later I still have yet to hear back. I’ve been calling everyday since the package was “delivered” and have yet to get a resolve.

As this was of no fault of my own the agent agreed and sent me a new code. I then re-trusted the website and placed another order for another item considering I just received something dirty from them.I ordered my jeans they arrived and were too big I then called up customer services and said listen I just want to exchange the jeans they only have one left in the size below can I do that to which (Anna V) The agent said no we don’t do exchanges you would have to place a new order I said well if that’s the case how can I get a new code she said I can’t it’s a part of our terms and conditions. So I’m now waiting to refunds and still not being allowed to just exchange my jeans and if I want them in the correct size I have to pay full price for them and lose out on the bronze loyalty discount I was originally offered.

I purchased a pair of expensive jeans, when they arrived the pricing label advertised them £157 / $220cheaper than I had paid.

I called them to get a refund; they told me that when an item has purportedly been delivered to the wrong address, their process involves an investigation that could take up to two weeks. That&apos;s fair. However, the &quot;investigation&quot; should not take days, let alone weeks, when the address that I provided to them is CLEARLY different than the address where the item was delivered. If you look at the responses to the negative comments, FARFETCH provides a &quot;canned&quot; response. They cannot even provide a personalized response, which shows you that they are a shoddy business. Please do not purchase from this company. I should have done my research before purchasing, but since I didn&apos;t, I&apos;m sparing you the trouble.Update 3 Jun:I still don&apos;t have a refund after 3.5 weeks post investigation...Update 17 Jun:I finally got a refund after emailing the president, board of directors and BBB.

Farfetch uses DHL for shipping and DHL is horribly backed up in the US Cincinnati hub. I had to make many calls over a week or so to DHL to get the package moving though I reached out to Browns/ Farfetch for help, I received none. When my ring finally arrived, I opened it up to find the same ring with no diamonds! It was clear from the documentation that Farfetch knowingly shipped the wrong ring because the order and the shipping paperwork were different. Very annoyed.

The parcel still hasn&apos;t reached the boutique, most likely it was lost, as the track number hasn&apos;t been updated for over a month. I wrote to customer service about it. They promised to help me, but in the end they said that I sent the parcel on their label incorrectly and that they would refund the money only when the boutique receives the parcel back. What was the bottom line? I have no money and no package. I want to open a dispute through PayPal, but Farfetch customer service tells me:“If you open a dispute with Paypal, it may delay the refund from our side, and block your account on the FARFETCH.”I feel cheated, the value of the parcel is 763.75 euros.

It did not have YSL tag on it but had Farfetch tag. I immediately contacted customer services (within 5 minutes of receipt). They arranged a return for me and told me that they cannot make an exchange for the same bag and if I wanted an undamaged bag I had to reorder this. I placed the order the same day and returned the damaged bag. The next day I received a “new” bag which was again all scratched, with peeled leather and dirty inside! It had a Farfetch tag on it but did not have YSL tag. It came all unprotected, without proper wrapping around the chain with white fur on the dust bag! I have arranged a return again. Now I am £2000 out of pocket and without a bag which I was trying to get in time for my Birthday. It looks like I will also most likely loose the delivery charges I had to pay (£10). Both bags came from YSL on Bond Street London and I can now see that a lot of customers had similar issues with them and complained to Farfetch.It appears that there is no quality control or inspection of goods carried out before these are sent to customers and Farfetch does not take seriously complaints from its customers or responsibility for poor service. This has caused me to loose a lot of money and time (which is the opposite of what should happen when you shop online). I would urge you to shop elsewhere unless you want to end up without money and with damaged/used goods when you paid for new ones.

","Hello, I have just received my Prada brooche from you today. However, the brooch has several major imperfections. Namely, there are several scratches on its surface: a very massively visible scratch on the right golden part just above the letter A; a scratch on the golden ellipse; the entire orange surface has several scratches on it; the blue surface has several scratches on it and a massive imperfection right at the bottom. I don&apos;t know whether your partner sent out the brooch in this condition, or it has been damaged during the shipping process. Moreover the color of the logo does not correspond to the images you provide. The images clearly show that the logo is silver, while what I received seems to be golden. In any case, this is really unacceptable and I do not understand how you can deliver the item in this condition, when stating on the website that the item is new. Moreover, the color of the logo does not correspond to the images you have on the website either...

My personal advice: always take pictures and videos while giving your package to courier. In case your package is lost, Farfetch will not help you, but DHL will. I ordered two sizes of the same boots, so that I could choose between them and see which ones fit better. After trying both sizes and choosing between them, I requested a return of one pair that didn’t fit. Never received an email with the return confirmation. Despite this, a courier came to pick it up on the day I chose on the website. I gave him a return label and package, he put it on the box, asked what was inside and that was it. The courier didn’t scan anything, I didn’t sign anything. I tracked the package the same day it was collected, the next day, the day after — nothing, no such tracking number. I contacted Farfetch, they opened DHL investigation. I took video and photos when courier was picking up my package (because i’m used to living in the world full of frauds), in those photos and video you could even see courier&apos;s car license plates, his identity which was supposed to make investigation easier and faster, but no, it seems they don’t launch any investigations, because after 14 days of this so called “investigation”, I received a message from Stephanie &quot;We have tracked your return with the tracking number provided on your prepaid return label and found that it was not delivered to the shipping partner as agreed and arranged. Therefore, we are unable to process the requested refund.&quot; Seems like they were just waiting for 14 days to give me this formulaic response.720 euros for nothing.

Upon arrival of your ordered item(s) you d better check the pricetag, because it is more then likely that you were ‘overcharged’ by Farfetch, meaning they owe themselves a sort of commission for selling the clothes of their partner boutiques! Scam with capital S! So I want a partial refund. Hello customer ‘care’, don t you care?? I m still waiting for you to come back to me ( and not here on Trustpilot)

"I would highly recommend NOT buying from Farfetch

","I would highly recommend NOT buying anything from Farfetch. FAR from being a good online site, I have purchased a pair of discounted Aeyde shoes in which I was eligible for free shipping due to the price of the shoes. Instead, I received a gucci belt, a totally different item and FAR from anything close to my purchase. In any case, I am not even sure if the gucci belt is authentic as there was no gucci-labelled dustbag and no gucci tags on the belt either. Proceeded with returning the item and demanded an exchange and was told that the pair of shoes I wanted was sold out in my size and as a form of &apos;GOODWILL&apos;, the staff gave me a promo code for free shipping instead -.- how idiotic could that get? promo code for free shipping when the price of my intended item could easily qualify me for free international shipping? Staff took days to tell me my feedback will be sent for review and weeks and months have come and gone and clearly they could NOT FETCH anything. Received my refund but due to difference in exchange rate, I am STILL SHORTCHANGED the amount that is equivalent to what one has to pay for international shipping. I would NOT give any stars for this review if I could and I am not even sure why anyone would endorse Farfetch. Better be wary.In my years of online purchase, I have not encountered anything like this poor customer service.

"DO NOT USE FARFETCH!!!!!

","DO NOT USE FARFETCH!!!!!! I ordered a belt from them, when the package arrived I noticed how beat up the box was. Upon opening the box I quickly discovered someone had gone into the box and stolen my belt. I quickly calles farfetch and they opened an investigation. Over 2 weeks later I get an email that said they would not be refunding me because I had selected no signature required when DHL dropped off the package. So despite me being home and the driver physically handing me the package they will not issue a refund. I have emailed and called and nobody will speak with me. What an absolute scam!!!!!

Will shop around a lot more now rather than relying on the integrity of farfetch and will let my friends know to do the same. Disappointing.

"Birthday promo code gone wrong

","I received a birthday promo code stating that I can get 20 off 200, 60 off 400 or 125 off 600 Euro spent and I decided to buy 2 pairs of GGDB sneakers. One of the received products was faulty (the inner sole was to big for the shoe and it was not possible to comfortably walk in them) so I contacted Farfetch and was told to return the item, that I will be refunded half of the delivery costs and that I will get a new promo code to order a new pair of sneakers as they do not offer the exchanges. After weeks of emailing with their customer service and getting several wrong promo codes, offering only 10% off of my new order and after receiving my money back for the faulty item but not the promised half of the postage I can only say that I am more than disappointed in the way they treat their customers. I have bought products off of Farfetch numerous times but this is no way to do business, no matter how big of a discount they offer. Shame on you Farfetch!!

So despite the fact it is not yet processed, I cannot amend the order (even though they have the size I need) and have to wait for them to arrive and send them back to exchange. It’s a £570 item, if they were already despatched that’s one thing, but not being able to make a phone call to their fulfilment company to sort something so simple is poor service. I won’t consider ordering again.

"Bad experience

","I ordered a pair of Gucci Heel Sandals for a special occasion and the state that it was delivered to me in was completely unacceptable, and what I would consider  shocking condition for a luxury brand. Gucci shoes are usually always packaged individually in dust bags - which was far from the case when ordering online through Farfetch. My shoes came wrapped in plastic, the sticky label on the bottom of the shoe had been torn off and when I looked closely, scuff marks were visible on the shoe. It was clear these shoes were a bad-quality return. After reaching out to customer service I did not even receive a follow up on how the complaint had been escalated when I had sent through the images of the shoes. No one should receive shoes in that state, and this is particularly bad due to the luxury brand standards Gucci as a company holds and the lack of upholding these standards on Farfetch’s behalf.

"False product description &amp; terrible packaging

","Since Farfetch offers great deals on many luxury pieces, I was inevitably intrigued to make a purchase. I ordered a bag which was described as new with tags. Upon receiving my product, I noticed that Farfetch sends products directly from boutiques around the world, a sweet approach in helping small businesses make sales. The bag was as described apart from the fact that the stickers that are usually on the metal tips of the bag were removed therefore had moderate scratches on them. Secondly the packaging of the item was appalling. The beautiful leather bag was wrapped in a piece of flimsy tissue paper and thrown in a brown box taped with the Farfetch logo. There was no protection at all, due to the bag tumbling and tossing in the card board box this may have been the reasoning behind the scratches on the bag. As I did not want to cause myself stress with returning the product, I have kept it and hope to make a use out of it. Farfetch please make it a protocol for the small businesses to use adequate packaging when sending out a product. After all these are luxury items and customers need to be provided with the luxury experience.

I understand that the bag was coming from the YSL store but it&apos;s still not good enough. This has wasted so much of my time ordering, arranging return couriers, waiting for the $ to be transferred back into my account etc.  I am very hesitant to use Farfetch again, it&apos;s just not worth it if they can&apos;t control the quality of the items that are sent from stores.

But we cross referenced item numbers and I was assured by that customer service representative that it was just an error and if I ordered again, the right item would get here in time for my birthday (where I live we can now go out to dinner in small groups - so I was excited to wear something pretty). So I ordered again. I was impressed when I even got a WhatsApp message saying they had followed up with the store to make sure the right item was sent this time. That turned out to be nonsense because, you guessed it, I received the wrong item again. I think the intentions of the customer service representatives are good. The actual help they can offer or control is absolutely minimum and sadly rather pointless. Little bit gutted to not be having a lovely new frock to wear next weekend.

To be honest, I do not care if someone tried or wear this clothes before. All I want is the clothes should be cleaned before it has been sent to the customer. The reason of the 2 star common is the materials of the clothes is still perfect and all the females&apos; hair and lipsticks imprint can be removed after washing. We all know that COVID-19 had infected our daily life. Also, It is a hard time for many companies. Therefore, some mistakes may happen or ignore.

They said they checked with the supplier in Italy who said they shipped it, which of course they would, and that’s as far as their support goes and asked me to deal with the parcel company myself, who of course also denied responsibility meaning I ultimately lose out.If you are selling designer products at high prices then you should guarantee safe delivery of those items, these things cost a lot of money for the average person.

The issue of &apos;trust&apos; and &apos;confidence&apos; are such an important factors when it comes to deciding on a purchase, especially an online purchase.

","I placed my order with express delivery on monday morning and was promised delivery by wednesday-friday. From there on there was nothing but disapointment and waiting. On wednesday I was asked to send proof of my payment details which I did right away. I did not hear anything until friday night when I was told my order had been cancelled. When I asked why the order was cancelled and attached the email conversation where I did submit all information shortly after the request to do so I was once again given the same answer. ”We tried to contact you to solve this issue and verify your order manually, but unfortunately you didn&apos;t reply in time”What I’m most disapointed with isn’t the order being cancelled but the time of the whole process and standard replies from customer service. I’m still waiting for my refund and won’t be buying from farfetch again.

"Unsatisfying

","It is my first time shopping at Farfetch. However the experience was not so good. The shoe I received was obviously worn for a long time by another customer. The inside of shoes is quite dirty. The leather on the heel was even scratched. If it is an old pair, the condition  at least should be described.

"don&apos;t trust this website

","don&apos;t trust this website, if you buy something from farfetch, they usually shipped within 2 days,, ok it&apos;s good, right? But once their partner refused to ship, you can only wait, even you send a email to farfetch CS ask for help, the only thing they could tell you that is “sorry and wait”, they are not available do anything to help you.

","Although the order come in a timely fashion. There was a strong smell from the box and on the item. Not sure like a chemical smell. The bag looked fine. I wish it had of come with a Fendi box though. As it is a clutch bag with 3D letters embossed on it. Which equals fragile. Afraid now it will get damaged as I have know box to store it in other then that. The price was amazing. I have made several purchases with Farfetch before. I have always had good service and the original box. Not sure what happened with this item.

"Price suddenly increased after delayed response to enquiry

","On 2 September 2018, I asked Farfetch for garment size information of a discounted item and was given a reply on the same day. However, there were some anomalies in the reply. So on 3 September 2018, I asked for further clarification of how each size/dimension was measured but there was no firm reply then. On 10 September 2018, I received a reply saying that my requested information was not forthcoming since Farfetch partner boutique was busy due to peak season. A suggestion was made to me to buy the garment first and, if not fit, a free return would be arranged for me. Surprisingly the Farfetch price was suddenly increased to more than double the original discounted price for the out-of-season garment! Of course, this deterred me from buying. Despite Farfetch’s free return policy, a refund may not be in full but with the deduction of first shipping cost. To a customer, right-first-time is for sure better than “return and refund” to avoid the time, inconvenience and cost involved.The garment actual dimension information for different sizes is very important for customers, especially inexperienced first-time customers like me, as the actual dimension varies greatly among different brands for the same size or even among different models of the same brand. This garment dimension information is conducive to facilitating customers to make immediate buying decision and is definitely a competitive advantage for online businesses. I believe that such information should be readily available from the garment designer/supplier. Indeed some other online shops provide detailed garment dimension for each garment on web. Farfetch seems to lag behind and needs improvement in this regard

"Not happy.

","Have shopped with Farfetch multiple times and most times they are great however this is the second time I’ve had my order cancelled and refunded. Do you know how disappointing it is when you finally found the item you’ve wanted at an amazing price just for it to be cancelled and refunded 24 hours later?I’m confused as to why it took an entire day for you guys to cancel it too, I even called customer service to see what was going on and the lady didn’t have the balls to tell me then that it was out of stock. Just as other people have been saying, stock needs to be regulated BETTER. Especially when buying luxury items as they’re expensive, I won’t get get the large sum of money back for a few days either. I can’t go and buy what I wanted now because my order has signaled to you that it’s actually out of stock. This becoming a common occurrence makes me not want to shop with them anymore, Ssense have never done this to me.

"Bad service

","Hello, I ordered from Czech Republic 3 things, price: € 3514.45: wallet, shoes and bag. The wallet and shoes came without problems in good stuff, but the bag for the delivery history was in Prague, but for some reason it was sent back, and didn’t deliver to the my address, I waited bag 5 days. The support service (Ana C. and Magda R.) told me that the payment failed and the bag was returned, but how can payment not be paid if the purchase was paid by one card, and two things have come, and the third is not. Then they said from the support service that the payment will be returned to the card, although there was an opportunity to return it to the credits of Farfetch and I can buy again without problem with card. First they must ask how it will be more comfortable for me to send them to the card or credit them. I&apos;m a buyer and I&apos;m right. People’s re working in a similar company should sell and help, and not be pofigistic. Negligent attitude, spoiled the mood, I say white, the support service says black, I will never use this service again, because with this bag I had to go on the friends wedding, and and now it’s spoiled, it&apos;s better to order directly from original boutique.

"Disappointing experience

","I thought it was perfectly safe to shop from Farfetch, so I went on and did my first purchase whith them a week ago. After one week, the status was still “reviewing order”. I started reading reviews online, and realized this is happening a lot. I contacted customer service, where the representative said he would check on it and “personally com back to me with info”. I never heard anything, but could see from the app that the order was canceled. I got the money refunded, but ended with a €20 loss due to currency fluctuations (I used a non-euro debit card, because why would I even dream of returning this perfect bag now that I finally located it online?). I understand that this issue is not necessarily  the fault of Farfetch alone, as they use subsupplers, but they need to seriously scrutinize their suppliers, many of whom use Farfetch due to lacking capacity to smoothly run an online retail service. Not surprising then that stock info is not up to date. The fact that I got a quick reply to my inquiry and that my money were rapidly returned, makes me give them a 2 instead of 1, but I will never shop with Farfetch again.

"Not the best customer service.

","Not the best customer service.I ordered an item I June and I received the wrong one. I immediately informed their customer service and asked for a refund.

Which is odd because normally there is always someone answering a phone or have their fingers on the keyboard, ready to work. Fast delivery as always

"They need to make it right...

","They don’t get 1 star...Yet.I’ve purchased many thousands of dollars of apparel from them.Their shipping was adequate, sometimes even impressive.  The products usually packaged neatly and as described.Their charges and promotions again tolerable to adequate but not outright spectacular.So, why the two stars? Simple, they misled me and refused to acknowledge the discount I was entitled to.They initially sent me the wrong item, then after I returned it, the new item they were going to send me suddenly ended up being out of stock only to then reappear on the site a day later for far more than the original discounted price.Again, all this, even though not preferred, was still tolerated.  They then offered me a 10% x 10% discount on my next order to not only compensate for all the inconvenience but also to account for the initial 10% discount I was never able to take advantage of.However, when I went to place the next order — 2 items totaling over $1,500, they informed me; nope, you get no discount. So, after a somewhat heated call, they acknowledged they’d only offer 10%, as though they were the ones doing me the favour. Ridiculous!I’ve spent upwards of 10k with Farfetch with intention to spend far more in the future but I would’ve expected a high enough level of customer service and at the VERY LEAST for them to honour what they promised to begin with.I’ll do my shopping with YOOX or Bluefly or Hervia or Genta Roma from now on instead.  One or two of them are actually more affordable anyway.So, Thanks Farfetch customer service for pushing me in the right direction.  You guys definitely deserve only two stars max.

I never received an email for the return and called the company to find out if it had arrived!. Never seeing a credit on my card, the long process began....After numerous phone calls, 7 calls to the company, I finally received a credit on this purchase. This was close to four weeks after they received the package. I received multiple excuses. Their customer service staff was both good and bad. First excuses were &quot;they had high volume&quot;, then a representative said  &quot;it took 3-4 weeks for a return&quot;; a couple days ago, I finally talked to someone who DID SOMETHING and got my credit within hours to post on my credit.

"PLEASE READ

","PLEASE READ. Disappointed with what I have just witnessed. I have used Farfetch before and have normally been reasonably happy with their services. However, on this occasion, I am saddened to see how low they have sunk. I received an email saying that there is an extra 20% off on all sale items. Intrigued, I decided to browse. What I noticed was that a lot of the prices on sale items had been inflated. For example, a few days ago, there was a men&apos;s Versace backpack for around about the £600 mark (marked down from £900). However, after checking today, the list price was now around the £800 mark. Therefore, this &apos;new&apos; 20% discount added to the current discount has now reduced this £800 price to the £600 price it was already a few days ago ! This would mean this &apos;special&apos; discount that I was notified about isn&apos;t actually saving you any more money and you would be paying a similar price to what the item was already on sale for. (The reason I know this is because I tend to browse this website daily to see if I can spot any new additions to the sale and/or more price reductions and I know the price was different a few days ago). Now, don&apos;t get me wrong, I understand that Farfetch are a company who need to make a profit. But, what I don&apos;t appreciate is this underhanded attempt to make out like they are doing YOU a favour and offering a &apos;sale&apos;. Either this practice should be addressed or I will never shop with Farfetch again. My advice to anyone using this website is this. If you are happy to pay full price OR the sale price for these items, got for it. Anytime I have ordered from Farfetch, my items were received as expected. If, however, you&apos;re being drawn in from an email or advertisement and you&apos;re looking for the best deal, you might be better off shopping from other outlets and online retailers before you purchase anything.

They claim this provides &apos;unparalleled choice&apos; and they &apos;guarantee the very best shopping experience&apos;...  Well, I placed my first order with Farfetch.com on 6th Jan on the understanding that the expected delivery date is between 12th Jan - 16th Jan. 9 days passed with no communication from the website itself nor their boutique partner before I finally made contact with Customer Services on 15th Jan. They were polite enough, but were essentially as useful as a chocolate teapot. They could not provide me with a satisfactory solution to the problem as Farfetch is really a &apos;middle man&apos; between you and the seller. There was a lot of &apos;we need to check with the boutique&apos; and &apos;we will need to get back to you&apos;. All in all, it took 2 emails, 2 phone calls and an awful lot of time and worry before my money got refunded back to me, with them citing it being out of stock as a the reason. I am surprised it took them 11 days to figure this out.I have never had so much trouble shopping from other luxury fashion websites. Farfetch did provide me with a modest goodwill gesture towards my next order, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be taking the bait!

This item had not been shipped from your partner, I called on Saturday last week, but your coworker at the customer service said that calling it back would not reach the stock/delivery dep. in time before shipping on Monday morning. We agreed on Farfetch shipping anyway, as I understood that cancelling was not at option. Agreeing or not did in my opinion not really make a difference as I did not have a choice. Anyway customer service wanted to call it an option. My option of preference would have been to cancel the ordered product, as requested. Another item is shipped without a strap that should have been included in the bag. I received the bag and contacted customer service regarding this missing strap. I have in a late feedback received the information, that caused to your partner being busy you have still not received any feedback on this strap. In my opinion a company have not delivered a product to a customer, before all items of the product has been received by the customer.For now, I have no idea whether I will receive my item purchased or not. But I have already paid for it. Not an acceptable experience.The 3 product of the order I have received as expected, and I only had a small comment on the textile for packaging. This was damaged and did not protect the bag entirely. As I consider this textile as a cloth bag, which purpose also is to protect the bag during delivery, I would have preferred this to be intact. I have already rated this part of the delivery on your rating system.Overall I am:1: still missing my strap for a quite expensive luggage bag purchased. 2: I am waiting on being credited for 1 quite expensive product of the order.I am sure that Farfetch can do better, and will expect for you to show your worth within a matter of few days.

I understand these are security measures but before you cancel the item shouldn&apos;t they call the individual. Then I called them to see what was going on with my order and asked why it was cancelled, they explained it was part of their safety measures (great) but why not notify before you cancel and the product becomes unavailable. THEN I reordered the same bag in a different color and thankfully everything went through. When I received the product it was a COMPLETELY different color that what I had purchased. The photograph clearly showed a salmon pink and the product I received was tan. I contacted customer service desk a couple times via email and phone and no one has gotten back to me.

Case and point, a Comme de Garcons T-shirt, 10,000 yen in a Medium and 16,000 yen in a Small or Large. (thats about $50 more) Ummm Why?! Does no one else see this? Anyways, my last complaint is I can&apos;t change the website into English for the life of me. Yes, I live in Japan but do I want to do my shopping in Japanese? NO! Get it together Farfetch!In response to customer service: I&apos;m not sure why you need to contact ME in regards to your own online pricing issues. That is something your web/marketing/sales team should keep track of regardless. And actually now that it&apos;s been brought to your attention start taking care of it. I&apos;m not going to e-mail your customer service to haggle over prices when I can go somewhere else without the hassle.

"Received Wrong Item And Unreliable Return Service

","I received a wrong item that I had actually purchased, I immediately returned it to Farfetch and emailed customer services. Customer services emailed me saying that the store apologizes for the mistake, have reserved and will send the correct item once they have received the return. What I do not understand is that it has been about two weeks since my return of the wrong item and I am still waiting for news for my exchange. Further to my return and delayed exchange of the wrongfully delivered item. I had to call Farfetch personally to further inquire. Whilst being put on hold for several minutes, I received an email informing me of a refund. This is rather curious as I was initially offered an exchange as I was sent a wrong item. I wonder how why a simple exchange solution could take such a long time and then complicate things with a refund?I really like Farfetch and was really impressed by their quick delivery, but when it comes to returns and exchanges I think that they should look into a better system or run the risk of loosing valued customers.Still no news from customer services about how they will rectify this.The final solution was a forced refund and a complimentary voucher for my inconvenience advising me to make my purchase of the correct item. After going through all that, it makes me wonder if I will continue shopping with Farfetch when there are many more sites that offer a better return and exchange policy.

"Wrong color

","This is the first time I shop from Rive Gauche (Rennes, France). I must say, I was surprised I never received a follow up after purchasing a pair of shoes from them, so I had to call to follow up with the order myself. Farfetch customer service was very good at helping me found out what was the status of my order. When my order finally arrived, I found that the pair of shoes this store sent to me was a completely different color from what I have ordered, the color is not even listed at farfetch web site. How this can be possible?. I needed these shoes for a trip and now is too late for returns so, I&apos;ll have to keep the wrong color.

When I purchased that item, it didn&apos;t quite as &quot;last one or low stock&quot;. And with payment using credit card, refunding into credit card would impose a currency exchange spread loss.

I would suggest your company may make sure the item is in stock before charging the client.It was good that the customer service answered my email quickly and helped me handle my query.

Farfetch contacted the boutique in which the sunglasses were dispatched from in Paris (Mode de Vue) who responded with &apos;the sunglasses are in the correct condition&apos;.  Obviously, I was both shocked and confused that the boutique was essentially &apos;fobbing&apos; me off. I decided to contact the brand directly, to get their opinion on whether the sunglasses were &apos;in the correct condition&apos;. Almost instantly, they responded to me advising that the sunglasses were definitely damaged and not in the correct condition - this information was fed back to Farfetch. I have since booked in a return with Farfetch, however have not heard back from the customer service and I&apos;m very disappointed that the issue was not resolved through them. And not to mention I will be losing out on postage cost for an error which was out of my control.

","I ordered a hoodie off their website on a monday from Italy and I live in Denmark. I received the order on friday, same week, which is why I credit them 2 stars. The disappointing thing is that the received item was not close to what I originally ordered. I received a random sweatshirt from the same brand, but in the wrong size, which to me is totally unacceptable. I was told during ordering that 1 hoodie was still in stock in my size, but have now been told that it is no longer in stock. I therefore can not make an exchange to the right item, but have to receive a refund, where I will likely loose money, due to the currency balance changing from time to time. It is from my point of view a big downside when a popular company like Farfetch makes such a mistake and would recommend you to being in better contact with your suppliers around the world, so mistakes like these does not happen.

Furthermore she eventually agreed that she would keep me posted on the outcome of my issue over email which she did not, I never received any follow up.  Overall a very disappointing experience, especially because of the poor attitude at your customer service department.

It should come in a proper suit bag hanging on a clothes hanger (preferably Alexander McQueen) and folded in half in the delivery box. This is how it is done in a top notch quality online shopping website (i.e. MR PORTER do this even with less expensive &amp; less reputable brand names, regular or sale items are treated the same). Good presentation is utmost important and common sense.2.A video presentation for each product seeing a model wearing the product will be very appreciated. It can help buyers see the product better - like attending a catwalk and not just seeing it in a magazine. You can see how the garment holds on the body with different movements 360 degree, how different details of the piece stand out, etc. For clothing, of course we all want to try it on before buying. But if we cannot do it, having someone doing it certainly help.In conclusion, highly recommended. I&apos;ll shop here again.

"A long time customer

","Well well ... It&apos;s one of those reviews where you don&apos;t really know from where to start.I will start by saying I have really left a fortune to them haha by constantly shopping and supporting them. So let&apos;s count the pros1) Genuine products lol :P2) Best prices especially when items are going on sale. Really love the fact that items are being discounted solid, instead of gradually reducing. You also have boutiques from all around the world all together in one platform, which is great it&apos;s like searcing something threw Lyst.com or Styleright.com, with the main difference that you get alarmed by them when a product that you selected as favourite goes on sale... Don&apos;t expect that with Farfetch.3) Real time benefits when you get to spend more,provided you by the Access programm. You get to know which items are going on sale first ( 3 days earlier I think) and you also enjoy some gifts (minor really) and customer service answering your mails in priority! I also think you can get tips for a stylist as well, but let&apos;s be honest you can find that on a bunch other sites :)4) Really fast shipping, express shipping with only 10 Euros cost (if you live in Greece like me, I think it&apos;s 5 for central Europe), something that they have improved over the time, as in the past years the shipping wasn&apos;t express.. that means that now you pay same cost and  you get different shipping. I have never got a package broken or stolen or anything, which is also important.5) You get to know from where your garments are being shipped a) to actually know which country you support &lt;3 and b) to avoid paying extra tools and taxes (especially now that the UK left EU ). Farfetch also infroms you when you are at the basket that you don&apos;t have to pay any extras, as they are including on the final price most of the time.6) From time to time they are making a 20% max discount to some items with terms and conditions of course. Don&apos;t expect to see that very often, especially on already discounted items, although this CAN happen on late February&apos;s final clearance and it DID also happened this past Black Friday.. Which leads me to the cons.. Now to the cons.As it is normal in all long term relationships there comes a point of conflict. There were times I felt like I was being treated like a number ($) not a person, in some of the cases.Again the customer service did answer to my mails, but not as someone that is in Gold-heading to Platinum-category of Access, rather someone they tried to avoid. When you get to spend a certain amount of money, you need to feel like someone who&apos;s treated right, don&apos;t you agree? That was they only downside, which ok it&apos;s minor but still, when I felt it I got really upset. Never got refunded of an item that supposed to be earlier in sale for me as a Golden Member, and after just 3 days of purchase they reduced it even more in 20%. Really annoying. Had to ask a manager to talk to... not even want to remember that.That was all folks, these were my experiences from what I can recall. I would strongly recommend it to pretty much everyone, but I wanted to share everythig, good or bad.

Also, there&apos;s a streak of light scratch/discolor on the cover flap of the bag, but I already took off the tag so I guess I&apos;ll have to keep it.

","My first order with Farfetch and I am really pleased with it. Easy to order and good communication. Quick delivery within a couple of days (the product was shipped from Korea). The jacket was available only on Farfetch and it was on my radar for almost a year, waiting for the most attractive price point, and I have noticed the price was reduced to almost 50% for a couple of months and then drastically increased for a couple of weeks and then dropped again. And for that practice one star less. Also, when comparing sale price to another sellers, and even original brand websites, the sale prices on Farfetch are higher. However I find browsing more pleasant compared to another stores.

","My experience with Farfetch is excellent in terms of product offerings, service, delivery time, and the ability to make returns.  This is why I choose to shop with Farfetch. The only negative I have is that I feel that the particular product I bought is over priced.  Granted the quality is excellent and looks brand new, but I found that a brand new item would cost a few thousand dollars less; the only difference was the color.  I understand that the color I have is harder to find, but not sure if a couple thousand dollars is worth the difference. I&apos;m still thinking it through.

I found a minor defect on the leather clip in front of the bag. It was a small scratch and looked a little bit discoloured.

After a couple of days I checked the status of my order and it went back to “purchase in progress” again. I called again and the person who answered my call sounds like a trainee and couldn’t give me a good answer, all she knows is the item I ordered will be coming from farfetch NJ and they couldn’t hold of them to confirm if the item is available or not and she told me they need to cancel my order. She told me the item is available but in different farfetch boutique which is in LA. My point is the customers have no idea where and what particular boutique our orders are coming from. Why they have to cancel my order and let me re-order again? (Worried of getting my money back and paying again for re-order) Why they didn’t call farfetch LA and just get my order from there? 4 stars because I re-ordered on dec 23 and received it the next day plus the dolce bag is a true beauty.

This task takes no more than 5&apos;. Return shipping as fast as shipping would be great, or at least the possibility to exchange the item for the same one in a different size or colour while being reserved once the return was requested by the client. During sale period, some shops don&apos;t process the order, leaving Farfetch clueless on when the item will be dispatched.

","Just got my YSL Lou camera bag! Ordered it on Monday (Oct 12), and received it Oct 16 (Friday). Order was processed after a day and shipped 2 days after it was in the preparation stage. Very well packaged. Called customer service twice for some questions I had and both times, the phone was picked up quickly and the CSR was very friendly, patient and helpful. The ONLY thing is, I wish the partner boutiques would also provide the original designer boxes for the item but that’s not up to Farfetch. However, perhaps Farfetch can put extra notes like that on each item, for example: “this item does not include the box or dust bag” so the customer will have a choice before purchasing.   They already give us the information on which country the item will ship from so adding which boutique it’s from would be helpful as well. Overall, I had a great experience shopping with Farfetch! Side note: for everyone that read a negative review about customer service, it wasn’t true in my case. Also, I took the liberty to contact YSL to verify that Farfetch is indeed authorized to sell their brand and that everything is authentic.

","The description of this very useful, 2-way bag is seriously lacking.  There is no mention of it having a separate WAIST belt that slides through the back top-edge flap (the function of which I could not understand from pictures).  As a result, (even though the waist belt is short) it exceeds my expectations.  Typical Mackintosh quality, but even their &quot;bonded cotton&quot; could use some explanation (I went to the Mac site for clear understanding).Otherwise, it is exactly the size and low-key appearance that i was searching for; that it was on sale sweetened its purchase and use.

","Good company. They has some really low prices on authentic garms. The website said the off white thong sandals were made in Italy but when i got them the sticker on the bottom said made in Indonesia. I spoke to them about this and its not a deal breaker as Browns uk assured me that it was an Authentic item and the quality is on par with my other authentic off-white clothing and accessories, I just never saw an Off White product made in Indonesia. The shipping is slightly high especially when your order only contains one product, but to ship internationally costs real money, so I can deal with paying $24 to have something shipped.

"Overall nice experience, but could be better

","Overall the experience is quite nice, the packaging is good and the shoes were intact, the seller also sent the shoes out for delivery very promptly.  As I would not be at home on the originally expected date of delivery, so I had rescheduled the delivery time.  However, the shipping company DHL was unable to deliver within the scheduled time (in the morning) that I was able to stay at home.  I need to ask my other family member to stay at home for receiving the parcel in the afternoon.Moreover, the shoes that I got finally was a bit oversized as I was just tried to pick the size that I generally wear for most of my shoes.   I know size of different brands could varies quite a lot, but I think adding the foot length in centimetres in the size chart could help me to get a more accurate size.  If there is a function to enter the size of my shoes of other brands/ model, then the system could suggest the size for the selected shoes for me, then it would be even better.

","The only reason I didn&apos;t give this review 5 stars is that I was not given a choice in shipping.  I really didn&apos;t need express shipping for $24.00, but there were no other options.  I do not think it was good customer service for Farfetch to assume that I would want express shipment and to provide no other options, just because an extra discount was promoted.Other than this dissatisfaction, the rest of the order was the usual great Farfetch quality and efficiency.

"A Farfetch First

","It was the first time I shopped on Farfetch and the experience was great.  They had the handbag I was looking for and I had a 10% discount code which I was so pleased about.  The delivery was super fast and I knew where my package was every step of the way - and boy, did it travel far to get to me ;-).  The updates gave me peace of mind and built up the excitement of course!  I am absolutely delighted with my new handbag!
