Item arrived in good time

Item arrived in good time, a little annoyed that the necklace was all knotted together and had to spend over an hour trying to get it right to be able to wrap it as a gift. But all in all a very good experience

Payment processing

It was difficult to place my order at first , a lot of verification for payment, this is my first time  of me buying online and asking me to send a copy of my id and card number details to check if its my card using for purchase.They cancelled my first order because they cannot verify my identity, they asked me to place a new order and send a copy of ID and picture of the card used for payment.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The Paul Smith T is nice except the price a little steep!

Customs clearance was a bit long‚Ä¶

Customs clearance was a bit long (because some information was missing) and for a 2500$ suit the packaging is a bit "minimalist". A suit cover and a hanger would have been welcome.

Really cool service this time.

Bag arrived quickly and as advertised.

Bag arrived quickly and as advertised.Just don‚Äôt understand why it was placed bare, as is, in the cardboard shipping box.I was surprised that it wasn‚Äôt wrapped in some sort of bag or at least in the black sac that comes with the bag.

Fast delivery.

As for the speed of the delivery and well packaged item sent to me, I would give five stars, the reason for only four stars is due to the sandals themselves, since compared to the black patent (same style and size as this one) one I had just bought a week ago, which fit flawlessly, these nude color ones seem slightly bigger and wider. It is as if the shoes were made in different factories, using different measurements.So needless to say will be returning these sandals, since they don‚Äôt fit and quiet look the same as the black ones.

Happy but important detail in description missed

Happy with the delivery and whole purchase process. I have many pairs of Birkenstock‚Äôs and so know that the size would be right, however there was no indication that this particular pair was in the Narrow cut (and so I thought it was the normal cut)  which I think is a vital piece of information!! I will keep this pair but next time I will make sure the details before purchasing.

It should be probably 2 or 3 stars

It should be probably 2 or 3 stars, because, after I bought an item, few days later, I received an email about refunding my money with no explanation. Any way, o contacted the Far fetch administration and they reacted very quickly to my email and explained me the situation (it was out of stock) and quickly ordered the same item from another seller and even covered my expenses. So, for this , I am very thankful. And I vas pretty happy until I got a message that I have to go and pick up the item from the DHL post office which is in the other side of my city. Usually courier brings the thing after I order, so I was a little bit upset.Thank you.Milda Vysniauskaite

The bag come with the dust bag without the box But everything else was good

The order arrived on time

The order arrived on time, but the packaging within the shoe box was really messy. No caring consideration of the shoes was there, the shoes were kind of dusty (have the impression that they have been wore before), there were 3 instead of 2 dusting shoe bags just thrown there and to my surprise there was no extra small underneath heel protectors as normally are.Although I was really anxious to own this particular pair, I have not made up my mind of whether I will keep it or not as I am kind of disappointed.

Excellent shopping choices

Excellent shopping choices. However -- several complaints:1) Shopping from ISRAEL has become much more difficult as the duties are not included in the price anymore. Basically, it's made returns very difficult and annoying. No more impulse shopping!2) The website: scrolling down the page: if you click on an item, on the return it does not go back to where you left off but rather to the top of the page. Not good...

it takes a long time to deliver the‚Ä¶

it takes a long time to deliver the products, especially those delivered with DHL and it should deliver faster !!
