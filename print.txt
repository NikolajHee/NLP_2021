Item arrived in good time, a little annoyed that the necklace was all knotted together and had to spend over an hour trying to get it right to be able to wrap it as a gift. But all in all a very good experience

2

It was difficult to place my order at first , a lot of verification for payment, this is my first time  of me buying online and asking me to send a copy of my id and card number details to check if its my card using for purchase.They cancelled my first order because they cannot verify my identity, they asked me to place a new order and send a copy of ID and picture of the card used for payment.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

perfect for daily use

I have been Gold customer for 2 years and I have never had a problem. I love I can get access to products not available in my country üëç The delivery service is really fast. Highly recommended !!!

5

The Paul Smith T is nice except the price a little steep!

6

Customs clearance was a bit long (because some information was missing) and for a 2500$ suit the packaging is a bit "minimalist". A suit cover and a hanger would have been welcome.

7

Bag arrived quickly and as advertised.Just don‚Äôt understand why it was placed bare, as is, in the cardboard shipping box.I was surprised that it wasn‚Äôt wrapped in some sort of bag or at least in the black sac that comes with the bag.

8

As for the speed of the delivery and well packaged item sent to me, I would give five stars, the reason for only four stars is due to the sandals themselves, since compared to the black patent (same style and size as this one) one I had just bought a week ago, which fit flawlessly, these nude color ones seem slightly bigger and wider. It is as if the shoes were made in different factories, using different measurements.So needless to say will be returning these sandals, since they don‚Äôt fit and quiet look the same as the black ones.

9

Happy with the delivery and whole purchase process. I have many pairs of Birkenstock‚Äôs and so know that the size would be right, however there was no indication that this particular pair was in the Narrow cut (and so I thought it was the normal cut)  which I think is a vital piece of information!! I will keep this pair but next time I will make sure the details before purchasing.

10

It should be probably 2 or 3 stars, because, after I bought an item, few days later, I received an email about refunding my money with no explanation. Any way, o contacted the Far fetch administration and they reacted very quickly to my email and explained me the situation (it was out of stock) and quickly ordered the same item from another seller and even covered my expenses. So, for this , I am very thankful. And I vas pretty happy until I got a message that I have to go and pick up the item from the DHL post office which is in the other side of my city. Usually courier brings the thing after I order, so I was a little bit upset.Thank you.Milda Vysniauskaite

11

All the process was done quickly and the order was delivered in good condition.

12

I wish there‚Äôs a rating on the items, or comment section.I really love how easy it is to return items and the browsing experince is really pleasantI wish there‚Äôs more coupons or discounts

13

Authentic product shipped directly from European and Asian retailers. A must for U.S. buyers.

14

The bag come with the dust bag without the box But everything else was good

15

The order arrived on time, but the packaging within the shoe box was really messy. No caring consideration of the shoes was there, the shoes were kind of dusty (have the impression that they have been wore before), there were 3 instead of 2 dusting shoe bags just thrown there and to my surprise there was no extra small underneath heel protectors as normally are.Although I was really anxious to own this particular pair, I have not made up my mind of whether I will keep it or not as I am kind of disappointed.

16

Excellent shopping choices. However -- several complaints:1) Shopping from ISRAEL has become much more difficult as the duties are not included in the price anymore. Basically, it's made returns very difficult and annoying. No more impulse shopping!2) The website: scrolling down the page: if you click on an item, on the return it does not go back to where you left off but rather to the top of the page. Not good...

17

it takes a long time to deliver the products, especially those delivered with DHL and it should deliver faster !!

18

The shoes box is broken but the product is okay

19

Everything was great but I was disappointed with the packaging ther is no brand bag or box but overall it‚Äôs good

20

Impressed in the fast delivery. Did not like the packaging as it was a gift, wish it came with the actual designer box instead of shipping packaging and dust bag.

21

The overall experience was good I didn‚Äôt receive a box for my Sunglasses I ordered I would like a box for such an expensive item.

22

I try to be really careful when ordering online and I appreciate the lovely items that you have on Farfetch! In this situation, sadly, my order had to be returned. I always wear a Small in Alexander McQueen. However, I didn't see an explanation that this particular top is constructed of two attached pieces!  The piece that has the skirt attached to it seems smaller than the T-Shirt! Therefore, this item does not fit.Also, when I took it to be returned, they said they had to charge me $5.00. The delivery time to me was excellent!I will certainly use Farfetch again!  Thank you!

23

Ordered Joseph leather leggings and they are stunning. The packaging was a bit basic for a luxury purchase (it came in a nondescript plastic packet), and I also had to pay ‚Ç¨13 for delivery which I think is a bit cheeky considering I paid over ‚Ç¨1k for the leggings. That's why I didn't give 5*.

24

Amazing and experience and genuine products

25

Great experience! So much to choose from.The only issue is that you end up getting your product from different locations, with different delivery time and end up paying the couriers fee per each package

26

Purchasing experience:greatPrices: a little inflated compared with competition .Regarding the item i purchased: I just find a little odd that a person that usually wears L-Xl finds a coat sized medium very very large. Is this size inflatiion?

27

Love the product and the selection I have brands that are offered, shipping is always very quick and painless! I do wish for the price of many of the items that the shipping packages were a little nicer, if the product could come in boxes instead of just brown bags I think that would be a little cleaner looking and a little safer for the product. Overall very good experience

28

In my previously orders the item price was including tax‚Äôs and now the tax is in addition.

29

Great customer service when I made my purchase, and having to return due to sneakers being too small. Very friendly and helpful staff

30

Nice Experience.. but hope to receive my order with the Full Original Packaging, including the official brand‚Äôs boxes and wrapping.

31

Quick response & ability to resolve issues

32

Really fast ship to australia , great product , and really good customers service .

33

Decent little buy

34

Great glasses, second pair!  Dhl sucks from europe

35

Quite quick, totally reliable, pre-owned section, and a loyalty program? It took me years to buy anything at Farfetch, now I think I'm hooked.With a bigger choice in designer clothes sizing (they exist! Those boutiques need to wake up!), Farfetch would be the absolute PERFECT shopping destination ;)

36

very nice store.  but there are problems.  there is no way to select and buy one item in the basket.  but only all together.  fix it and you will have the best store I've seen

37

Love their products and their sales, however sometimes when i place orders they then tell me its out of stock and then process a refund. A little bit annoying but still good overall!

38

Really good service! The goods came fast and everything was ok. There was some problem with the site, the first price was lower with 5-10 euro, but after I start to my checkout it was changed. But no problem :)

39

fast shipping/delivery and easy returns process. Would love if it was like other retailers where as soon as the courier picks up the return package, they process the refund back to my account.

40

I am generally very pleased with the services from Farfetch. The experience is consistently great: the app is super, I can search and filter and find whatever I am interested in. The purchasing is quick and painless. The delivery services work wonderfully. It was the case with this purchase too. It would have been a 5-star review if the product was exactly like in the photos. The photo of the product showed the dress in much lighter colours then the actual product I received. It is a very beautiful dress and I will keep it, however the experience had a little "meh" in it because of this.

41

Though I had experience delayed on my order due to technical issue but you still managed to deliver my item with great service and commitment.

42

easy ordering process . product received on time in good condition

43

First and 2nd experience was great. Just have a lil scratch on the accessories i purchased, but well not much to complain since the discount is real.

44

Fast delivery Item is good, but since I bought expensive item I expected a little better package, mostly because it was gift‚Ä¶

45

Very fast delivery but the blazer came packed in a small box,very wrinkled .For a double breasted wool blazer to be packed as a mans shirt and wrapped in paper and squished in a small box is not the Wayfair it should be done.

46

I ordered several times from them, I love there service, the packing, delivery, the payment goes very smooth with them.Although I don‚Äôt have an idea about returning service.

47

I would like to receive sooner!!Best regards, Vasiliki

48

Good and reliable online shopping website. Good price when there are irresistible promotions. Good quality product photos and descriptions. The Farfetch Fit Predictor helps me get the perfect size for my Alexander McQueen jacket (US$ 2,835). Thanks to its recommendation "Run small, considering sizing up". Good job on that. I might have to waste time returning the product if I were to order my regular size. Delivery is also fast with DHL Express.Points for improvement:1.Disappointed when the product arrived in a small black clothes bag like a big shoes bag. It should come in a proper suit bag hanging on a clothes hanger (preferably Alexander McQueen) and folded in half in the delivery box. This is how it is done in a top notch quality online shopping website (i.e. MR PORTER do this even with less expensive & less reputable brand names, regular or sale items are treated the same). Good presentation is utmost important and common sense.2.A video presentation for each product seeing a model wearing the product will be very appreciated. It can help buyers see the product better - like attending a catwalk and not just seeing it in a magazine. You can see how the garment holds on the body with different movements 360 degree, how different details of the piece stand out, etc. For clothing, of course we all want to try it on before buying. But if we cannot do it, having someone doing it certainly help.In conclusion, highly recommended. I'll shop here again.

49

Had to pay additional taxes (of which possibility I was warned beforehand) but otherwise everything went smooth. Got myself some items I couldn't find anywhere, and even for a reasonable price, so the experience was overall pleasant.

50

Great piece Love the details and quality and the precise time in delivery

51

1) I had a code for SAR450 discount and suddenly it disappeared?2) I dont like that price changes on the same exact item but different size!

52

My wallet looks amazing, but there was a couple of plastic stuck into the wallet ( did not look like a scratch) but i did manage to remove it with my nails using tissue. Im assuming since it was the last piece, it was probably on display. On the other day, i think the packaging could use an upgrade, please put things to stop the product from moving inside the box, as i could hear the wallet move left & & right inside the package. Which could damage it.

53

Very fast and awesome quality it would be great if they were sent together and in one package

54

Ordering and delivery was absolutely fine. however I will be returning the item its too small.

55

Everything is great except the delivery company. They didn‚Äôt contact me while delivering my item, sadly they put it outside my home without informing me.

56

It is good and efficient service, but I received the promotion code cannot use , the reason show that was expired. If have expiry date please notice the customer.

57

Beside the delay of my parcel, iam very happy with what i have received!I understand that the delay was cause by the 3rd party for delivery

58

I'm happy with my order in terms of online ordering process, delivery timeline, packing, thorough guidelines for receiving the good and return, etc. The product is slightly different from my expectation however I'm happy with my order. I will buy more from Farfetch.

59

High quality product.Quite good price.User friendly order process.Fast delivery.But prefer plastic packing to avoid getting wet during transport.

60

Before payment for this item it was started that import duties are included which means to me I‚Äôm not paying anything extra apart from shipping. Even in the last time i shopped with Farfetch i was told shipping is going to be free for me next time I shop this was never applied. That is my only concern

61

Jacket is beautiful! It‚Äôs a good thing it was nothing fragile because the delivery package was practically demolished!

62

Got the item very quick. It‚Äôs my first time purchasing in farfetch as I was a little bit skeptical about it‚Äôs legitimacy. But it did not disappoint, item is in good condition and it‚Äôs authentic. Though it did not come in its original box but it‚Äôs okay, they packed my bag nicely.

63

The order came pretty fast & I really appreciate that

64

Great product. Wish there was quicker shipping options.

65

Good packaging and great speed of delivery

66

To be honest I really loved the whole experience, everything I bought from them is authentic, and the delivery is fast but the problem is the packaging !!the box came open without the original box of D&G and for me that was very disappointing

67

Copped my fit this is my go to place for Luxury pieces . With those prices you cant beat them.

68

They shipped me different t-shirt from another brandü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

69

I love this website, many choices and good price

70

Due to a narrower last than other Philip Models in the past, the shoes were returned today, but not without some confusion over the DHL procedure.  A phone call cleared all that away by acknowledging that the return site for this order was the USA, so a simple UPS label was all that was needed.

71

The delivery was perfect very fast.But the conditions of the espadrilles is not perfect how you can buy from the shop.

72

The bag and service was A++ perfect but I have to tell you that when the box showed up from UPS it was mangled! The box was crushed, all ripped up one side and I find this extra annoying because the item I ordered was shipped from a local boutique. It was shipped yesterday and I received it today all crushed.  Luckily the bag was not damaged but you should know that UPS didnt really take good care of the package :-/

73

Great choice of very diverse products and brands and fast shipping

74

The piece I ordered was stunning, however it took a longer than the estimated delivery time

75

All good - professionalism

76

my product some smudge on the small tag on the side, and has a scratch on top of the box. but aside from that everything was fast and good.

77

First time ordering from here, delivery was fast took about a week to get to Washington state. Very authentic. I sure will be ordering more from here again.

78

Great shopping , very nice item but terrible delivery experience  with DHL

79

Fast shipping/delivery. Good quality products.

80

Nice purchase and shipping experience.Although this website does not carry very attractive pricing, the service and products availability is tops. I recommend it.

81

The service is fantastic, but it would help a lot if you did more with sizing. I am a size 10 AUS, 6US. I purchased a Marc Jobs T-shirt in a large and it was too small. To send it back you wanted to charge me $45!!!!!. I then ordered the extra large and it is a perfect fit.

82

I love my purse for my baby girl it‚Äôs exactly what I expected it to be!

83

Prompt service and delivery. It helps that the article is the same as the article you delivered to me in November 2020. DHL delivery driver is good and prompt.

84

Plenty good choices of products..It will be great to have free delivery since many online retailers offer such.

85

Good product range. Discount is average.

86

Great service but delivery came later than the scheduled time. Realized that DHL Repacked my Order and I couldn‚Äôt find the invoice for my second package.

87

Loved my item. Surprised it didn‚Äôt come in a Ferragamo bag considering the money I paid for the item.

88

My order shipped very fast from Farfetch it just took a long time to arrive. The box was burst open when I received it but nothing was damaged as thankfully they had it well wrapped up in the box.

89

Your application  doesn‚Äôt update me properly

90

I love and appreciate Farfetch, & the overalls are absolutely wonderful. They are missing the strap fastening buckles, which I'm not sure if that's just how they come or not but I'll find replacement buckles. Sincerely, thank you!

91

Your service was always a good one. But I was hoping that delivery would be within 3-5 days. Anyways, delivery time of seven days may be good enough. Hoping that it is the maximum delivery time that you can offer. Thank you.

92

Took one day longer than standard transit date

93

Loved the product and how fast I received it. Love that far fetched had different options of payments like Klarna. My only thing is that I wish the product t came wrap better and more presentable since they are luxury good. I brought a Versace bag I I thought I will receive it in a Versace box like they give in the stores. Otherwise highly recommend!

94

Good offer that came up to $389 whereas in-store it would have been $555. Fast shipping via DHL from Italy. Only thing is the packaging of the parcel could have been so much nicer and more fancy.

95

Product shipped promptly and authentic as advertised

96

The mobile app or website is very easy to use- browsing is easy with clear navigation and pages loading quickly. Items are current season or new season with previous seasons available but sell out fast. Items arrived well packaged and despatched in timely manner and arrived in good order. Can‚Äôt find any fault so far with Farfetch except sizing is limited to whatever is available from the specific boutique. Two thumbs up for luxury shopping at your fingertips.

97

Ordering was easy and receipt of goods was prompt.  However, item was not as described on website (fabric wrong) and has to be returned.

98

Loved that the items shipped quickly: 4 days from Warsaw to Manila. One shoe, however, arrived with a scratch and it‚Äôs too much trouble to return. Also, site descriptions of products could do better: items were described as either ‚Äú100% leather‚Äù or ‚Äúpatent leather‚Äù; they turned out to be synthetic leather.

99

Well well ... It's one of those reviews where you don't really know from where to start.I will start by saying I have really left a fortune to them haha by constantly shopping and supporting them. So let's count the pros1) Genuine products lol :P2) Best prices especially when items are going on sale. Really love the fact that items are being discounted solid, instead of gradually reducing. You also have boutiques from all around the world all together in one platform, which is great it's like searcing something threw Lyst.com or Styleright.com, with the main difference that you get alarmed by them when a product that you selected as favourite goes on sale... Don't expect that with Farfetch.3) Real time benefits when you get to spend more,provided you by the Access programm. You get to know which items are going on sale first ( 3 days earlier I think) and you also enjoy some gifts (minor really) and customer service answering your mails in priority! I also think you can get tips for a stylist as well, but let's be honest you can find that on a bunch other sites :)4) Really fast shipping, express shipping with only 10 Euros cost (if you live in Greece like me, I think it's 5 for central Europe), something that they have improved over the time, as in the past years the shipping wasn't express.. that means that now you pay same cost and  you get different shipping. I have never got a package broken or stolen or anything, which is also important.5) You get to know from where your garments are being shipped a) to actually know which country you support <3 and b) to avoid paying extra tools and taxes (especially now that the UK left EU ). Farfetch also infroms you when you are at the basket that you don't have to pay any extras, as they are including on the final price most of the time.6) From time to time they are making a 20% max discount to some items with terms and conditions of course. Don't expect to see that very often, especially on already discounted items, although this CAN happen on late February's final clearance and it DID also happened this past Black Friday.. Which leads me to the cons.. Now to the cons.As it is normal in all long term relationships there comes a point of conflict. There were times I felt like I was being treated like a number ($) not a person, in some of the cases.Again the customer service did answer to my mails, but not as someone that is in Gold-heading to Platinum-category of Access, rather someone they tried to avoid. When you get to spend a certain amount of money, you need to feel like someone who's treated right, don't you agree? That was they only downside, which ok it's minor but still, when I felt it I got really upset. Never got refunded of an item that supposed to be earlier in sale for me as a Golden Member, and after just 3 days of purchase they reduced it even more in 20%. Really annoying. Had to ask a manager to talk to... not even want to remember that.That was all folks, these were my experiences from what I can recall. I would strongly recommend it to pretty much everyone, but I wanted to share everythig, good or bad.

100

Delivery time is great even they delivered my product 2 days before the estimated day.Returns product is very easy & friendly treat with them

101

fast shipping. if offer more discount for vip would be better

102

Good site... Quick delivery time... Product as described... Very happy with purchase... Will use again..

103

Fast delivery, however, there‚Äôs some difference in the colour

104

Im absolutely satisfied ordering via Farfetch.  The customer service is top notch and the shipping was amazingly quick. I love how they always have new products before anyone else does here.

105

It's a decent experience, although it feels like it's taking a little long for the bag to arrive (7 days).  Also, there's a streak of light scratch/discolor on the cover flap of the bag, but I already took off the tag so I guess I'll have to keep it.  I hope that you're not selling defected items unknowingly.  If the item is on sale due to defects, please let your customer know up front so they know what they're paying for.

106

In general I believe that with the item you are sending you should also send a bag, and the original box of the item. In a lot of cases the product is intended for a gift and not always personal use. Especially now during pandemic, an appropriate packaging is important

107

Hello I have just received the item but is much bigger than expected. I will see if I will keep it or not. Besides this the delivery was ok and very quick.Thanks

108

Love these earring big beautiful and shiny. Not too crazy about clip ons but they don‚Äôt hurt your ears .

109

Great selections and customer service. I buy from them regularly. As a vegan I like that PETA has shares in the company and that they don't sell fur items. However its disappointing that they still sell exotic skins. Makes me want to shop less frequent. Prices tend to be more expensive than their rivals.
